# Internet Adoption Over Time

This project is an interactive narrative visualization designed to show the growth and disparities of internet adoption globally over time. It uses D3.js and follows a Martini glass narrative structure to guide users through key trends before letting them explore detailed data by country.

## Overview

There are three main scenes:

1. Global Internet Penetration Over Time — shows overall growth worldwide from the 1990s to recent years, highlighting rapid adoption.

2. Internet Penetration by Wealth in 2024 — focuses on disparities by income levels, showing infrastructure and adoption differences.

3. Internet Usage Over Time by Country — interactive scene where users can select countries and see their internet adoption trends, reflecting policies and infrastructure.

## Narrative Visualization Techniques

- Line and bar charts show trends and wealth comparisons.

- Annotations highlight important events and trends.

### Scenes
