# Internet Adoption Over Time

This project is an interactive narrative visualization designed to illustrate the growth and disparities of internet adoption globally over time. Implemented using D3.js, it follows the Martini glass narrative structure to guide users through key trends before allowing exploration of detailed data by country.

## Overview

The visualization consists of three main scenes:

1. **Global Internet Penetration Over Time:** This scene shows the overall growth of internet usage worldwide from the early 200s to recent years, highlighting rapid adoption.

2. **Internet Penetration by Wealth in 2024:** This scene focuses on disparities in internet access across regions categorized by income levels, illustrating differences in infrastructure and adoption rates.

3. **Internet Usage Over Time by Country:** This interactive scene allows users to select a country and explore its internet adoption trend over time, reflecting national policies and infrastructure progress.

## Narrative Visualization Techniques

### 1. Messaging

The primary message is to showcase the dramatic increase in global internet adoption while highlighting ongoing regional and national disparities in access and infrastructure.

### 2. Narrative Structure

This project follows the **Martini glass** narrative structure:

- **Guided Narrative:** The first two scenes provide a focused story with minimal interaction, showing global and wealth based internet adoption trends.

- **Exploration:** The final scene lets users explore detailed internet adoption trends by selecting specific countries.

### 3. Visual Structure

Consistent visual layout and style are used across scenes for clarity:

- **Line and Bar Charts:** Line charts depict adoption trends over time, and bar charts illustrate regional comparisons.

- **Annotations:** Important events and trends are highlighted through annotations to provide context and insights.

### 4. Scenes

The visualization is divided into three scenes:

- **Scene 1:** Line graph showing global internet penetration from the 1990s to the present.

- **Scene 2:** Bar chart comparing internet penetration percentages by income-based regions in 2024.

- **Scene 3:** Interactive line graph of internet adoption over time for selected countries.

### 5. Annotations

Annotations emphasize key moments and trends:

- **Scene 1:** Highlights milestones in global internet growth.

- **Scene 3:** Includes annotations for important years or events at the country level.

### 6. Parameters

Key parameters include:

- **Selected Year Range:** Defines the period displayed in the charts.

- **Selected Country:** Determines the country data shown in the third scene.

- **Current Scene:** Tracks which scene is active.

### 7. Triggers

User interaction controls visualization changes:

- **Next/Previous Buttons:** Navigate through scenes.

- **Country Dropdown:** Filter and display data for the selected country in the third scene.

## Usage

- **Next/Previous Buttons:** Navigate between the three scenes.

- **Country Dropdown:** Select a country to view its internet adoption trend over time.

## Dependencies

- **D3.js:** For building charts and visualizations.

- **d3-annotation:** For adding explanatory annotations.
